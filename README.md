# Lyrics-based Mood Classification Project

## Overview

This project presents an NLP-driven mood classifier for song lyrics, leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance music recommendation systems. The classifier achieves an accuracy of 77.08% using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with word2vec embeddings, outperforming traditional lyric-based models.

## Key Features

- **NLP-driven Mood Classifier**: Utilizes CNN with word2vec embeddings to classify the mood of song lyrics.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 77.08% accuracy, surpassing traditional models.
- **Model Comparison**: Compares deep learning models (CNN w2v0, CNN w2v1) with traditional machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM).
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the Million Song Dataset to train and evaluate models.

## Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For processing and analyzing song lyrics.
- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with word2vec embeddings.
- **Traditional Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Python Libraries**: Keras, Sci-kit Learn.

## Applications

- Enhances music recommendation systems by accurately classifying the mood of songs.
- Advances NLP applications in the music industry.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in improving the accuracy of mood classification from song lyrics, providing a valuable tool for music recommendation systems.
